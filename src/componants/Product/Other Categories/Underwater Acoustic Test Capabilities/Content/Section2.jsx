    para : ' Since 1973, Gearing & Watson has built an impressive range of underwater products. With Gearing & Watson now part of Data Physics, this legacy continues. Data Physics offers complete turnkey solutions for underwater acoustic tests, including sound sources, transducers, drive electronics, towfish, tow cables, full handling systems, trials support and service.SignalSound underwater acoustic products provide a versatile means of projecting simulated target spectra at sea â€“ for operation with all types of passive sonar and passive ranging systems. Low frequency underwater projectors (hydrosounders) also produce pulses for exercising intercept sonars, and they include an echo repeat sub system for operation with active sonars.',
